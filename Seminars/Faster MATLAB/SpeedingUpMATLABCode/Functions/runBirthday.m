function prob = runBirthday(numTrials, groupSize)%#codegen
% RUNBIRTHDAY Runs a Monte Carlo simulation using the Birthday Paradox
% code
%    PROB = RUNBIRTHDAY(NUMTRIALS, GROUPSIZE) Calls the birthday code
%    NUMTRIALS times to see if any birthdays match in a group of size
%    GROUPSIZE.  The return value is the probability that a match will be
%    found.

%    Example:
